# Code of Conduct

:::{note}

This is an informal Code of Conduct, and is used as a stand-in best practice until we formally define a CoC and response process for this community.

:::

## Report

Report instances of unacceptable behavior that violates our Code of Conduct by sending an email to the following address:

```{button-link} mailto:executablebooks-conduct@googlegroups.com
:color: primary
E-mail the Code of Conduct committe
```

This address is monitored by the Code of Conduct committee, which is currently comprised of the {team}`Steering Council` of the project.

## Policy

The Executable Book Project follows a community
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/executablebooks/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Please use that document as the source of truth for interacting with the EBP
community.

```{button-link} https://github.com/executablebooks/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
:color: primary
Code of Conduct
```

## Future plans

In the future we aim to create a more formal Code of Conduct reporting process and team of people to respond to CoC violations.
Please monitor and provide feedback in [the `team-compass/` repository](https://github.com/executablebooks/team-compass) as we explore the best path forward.
