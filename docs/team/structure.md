# Team structure and responsibilities

## Expectations of all team members

Here are a few expectations we have of anybody that is formally on an Executable Books team.

**Adhere to the Code of Conduct**. All contributors to the Executable Books Project (including but not limited to individuals contributing code, providing technical support, discussing in repositories, teaching workshops, or discussing changes to EBP policy) are expected to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](policy:coc).

For past members of the {team}`Core Team` or {team}`Steering Council` that no longer wish to have the responsibilities of team membership.
Generally speaking, if a team member wishes to have their team status and responsibilities re-instated, they simply need to ask another core team member.
