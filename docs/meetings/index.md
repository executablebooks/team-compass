# Team Meetings

We occasionally have team meetings to discuss important topics in-person and to invite broader participation from others.

## Meeting structure

We use [this HackMD for an agenda](https://hackmd.io/THymMOAmSICp8rJdB6_Z1w?edit) and relevant meeting information.
If you'd like to discuss something at a meeting, add an entry in the HackMD before the meeting.

We generally go through agenda items as they're written, though others are welcome to bring items to discuss during the meeting and discuss if we have time.

After the meeting, we post meeting notes in a public location so that others can read and discuss asynchronously.

## Meeting dates and calendar

We try to meet monthly, on the **first Wednesday / Thursday of the month (depending on time zone) for 1 hour**.
Double-check in [our forum](https://github.com/executablebooks/meta/discussions) if you intend on joining, as we don't _always_ have the meeting depending on our availability and capacity.

This calendar has dates for upcoming events in the Executable Books community.
