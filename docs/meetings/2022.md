### Notes

- `myst-spec` - @fwkoch, @rowanc1, @chrisjsewell
  - over the past month, we've put together a language-agnostic repo of JSON schema types for the MyST AST nodes, building on existing `mdast` types.
    - github: https://github.com/executablebooks/myst-spec
    - dist: https://unpkg.com/browse/myst-spec/dist/
  - This also includes test cases, similar to the commonmark spec, which may be used to validate implementations of the spec
  - `mystjs`, the markdown-it javascript implementation, already consumes myst spec
  - [`unified-myst`](https://github.com/executablebooks/unified-myst), the new unified ecosystem implementation, will also be "spec compliant"!
  - python side hasn't been adressed quite yet.
- [Unified MyST](https://github.com/executablebooks/unified-myst)
  - There are some drawbacks of markdown-it
    - It doesn't have a well specified AST
    - myst-spec uses `mdast`, but that's a "unified ecosystem" thing, not a markdown-it thing
  - Unified ecosystem has their own parser called [micromark](https://github.com/micromark/micromark) (and that is bundled in [remark](https://remarkjs.com/))
  - The [unified-myst](https://github.com/executablebooks/unified-myst) parser uses this framework instead of markdown-it
  - Q: **What's the relationship between all of these parsers?**
    - MyST-js would use the unified parser
    - VSCode uses markdown-it-docutils (not even mystjs)
    - Unified ecosystem is well-maintained with many extensions
  - Q: **how do all of these pieces fit together for the end-user experience?**
    - We should have a strategy meeting about the direction of these pieces so that we can align on a path forward.
    - There is not currently a "product" at the end that is driving all of this forward (from an end-user's perspective).
  - Q: **This seems like a lot of stuff to maintain. How can we sustain our efforts?**
    - We have a bunch of stuff we've added to grow our maintenance burden.
    - Can we tie the JS myst stuff to end-users in a way that we can fund?
    - General agreement that we need a better story around the strategy and maintainability of this stack.
  - Product strategy meeting?
    - Bring in multiple stakeholders around a "product vision / strategy" for where the ecosystem could move going forward.
    - Could we bring the learnings from the JS world back into the Python world to improve Jupyter Book.
- Curvenote renderer for multiple composable "JupyterBooks"
  - Hosting a conference at end of April!
  - https://transform.softwareunderground.org/
- CH: New book theme is out, will update Jupyter Book to use it soon!

**Note: we did not get to the following topics, but there are some notes**

- [Gated Directives (sphinx-exercise)](https://ebp-sphinx-exercise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax.html#alternative-gated-syntax). There has been some comments and interest in making this syntax more general so it could be used for other directives.
  - Best Strategy? As an extension?
  - Mention this with work being done on `myst-spec`
- First Developer Interview: "Deep Dive into Parsing" (with Chris Sewell)
  - https://github.com/executablebooks/meta/issues/672#issue-1147568262
  - cover myst-parser, markdown-it-py
  - Any questions? Please add it to the issue.
  - Will post a recording to share more widely.
- JupyterLab Myst Extension as you go
  - Editing experience in jupyter is very critical!
- MyST Docs
  - New repository? Migrate and refurbish content?

### Short updates

- mystjs initial release!
  - https://github.com/executablebooks/mystjs
  - https://executablebooks.github.io/mystjs
  - And many other PRs updates in the JS world (e.g. docutils state, packaging)
- release of myst-parser v0.17.0 (https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/develop/\_changelog.html), jupyter-cache v0.5.0 (https://jupyter-cache.readthedocs.io/)
  - Both feed into https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-NB/pull/380
- soon-to-be-released sphinx-book-theme (v0.3). in pre-release now but haven't gotten any negative feedback. https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-book-theme/releases/tag/v0.3.0rc1
- sphinx-togglebutton also released w/ smaller footprint: https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-togglebutton/releases/tag/v0.3.0

### Notes

#### mystjs / myst-spec discussion (@rowanc1)

- Functionality, demo, myst "spec", reflections and thoughts on next steps!

- Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lLJUgILhBAZeLyUXucHtQGsA9OjqlSoIjop5_bFVTWg/edit

- Questions to answer

  - Should MyST exist as a first-class project within Executable Books?
    - General yes
  - Where should its "project" documentation live?
    - `myst.tools` ?
    - `spec.myst.tools`?
    - Agree to do this
    - Chris H will get the domain (UPDATE: Chris got the domain, now we just need to point something to it).
    - Figure out the following two later:
      - `python.myst.tools` -> myst-parser docs? (maybe we rename to `myst-python`)
      - `js.myst.tools` -> `mystjs` docs?
      - No decisions made here, we'll get to it later.
  - How do we avoid duplicating a bunch of documentation etc.
    - Define the core myst spec in a single repo, along with implementation-agnostic syntax
  - Unit tests of the spec - where do they live?
    - Use `chrisjsewell/myst-spec` for this?
    - Generally agree this is a good place to do it, need to consolidate docs somehow.

- myst-spec: https://myst-spec.readthedocs.io

  - Did a quick demo of the spec to compare w/ mystjs

#### myst-nb / embedding code outputs (@chrisjsewell)

- https://github.com/executablebooks/meta/issues/681
- https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-NB/pull/380 is basically ready to go apart from this
  - Perhaps merge, then work on this separately?

#### Developer interviews (@mmcky)

- I will be coordinating a series of developer interviews (recorded via Zoom) on a range of topics
- Proposal: Deep dive into Parsing: myst-parser, markdown-it-py and MyST Specification
- Developer: @chrisjsewell
- Compiling questions which I will organise into a logical interview. Please add to https://github.com/executablebooks/meta/issues/672
- Target Date: Mid-March 2022

### Agenda items

- \[Matt\] Planning to place an emphasis on Bug/Issue reduction for February (perhaps after the refactors for myst-parser, myst-nb)
  [Issue/Bug Reduction Priorities](https://github.com/executablebooks/meta/issues/649) is an issue on the meta repo to record any issues/bugs you are:
  1. able to work on
  1. really want fixed to move something forward
- \[Matt\] Organise a session with Chris S on "The architecture of Jupyter Book" to flesh out some of the areas I am not familiar with such as: markdown-it / markdown-it-py etc. to make improvements for developer docs.
  - Can you record this?! (@mmcky -- good idea)
  - Three Common Ways to Extend Sphinx
  - Overview of JupyterBook
- \[Steve\] Thebe next steps - driven by requirements for hookup to interactive web components
  - refactor to a (Typescript) core, update current js library to use it.
  - library also made available on npm.
  - Issue open for discussion here https://github.com/executablebooks/thebe/issues/536
  - @mmcky If you need beta testers, we would be happy to help test on QuantEcon projects such as: https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html
- \[Chris H\] Feedback on book theme structure / visuals?
  - Demo: https://sphinx-book-theme--472.org.readthedocs.build/en/472/
  - General agreement that this looks a lot better than the current released version.
- \[Chris H\] Feedback on carets / toggle buttons
  - Demo: https://readthedocs.org/projects/sphinx-togglebutton/builds/15966583/
  - Chevrons instead of + signs?
  - Widescreen toggles - could we re-use from sphinx-design ?
