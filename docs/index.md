# Executable Books Team Compass

This documentation serves as the **Source of Truth** (SoT) for the Executable Books community policy and strategy, and defines its organizational structure and governance.
It also aims to provide resources that facilitate contribution and coordination among team members.

:::{admonition} Work in progress!
:class: caution

This site is a work in progress, as the project begins to formally define its structure and governance.
Some information may be duplicated or contradictory with information at [executablebooks.org](https://executablebooks.org) - if it is, treat the information here as the source of truth.
[See this GitHub issue to track our progress on this migration](https://github.com/executablebooks/meta/issues/857)

## Goals of the Team Compass

The Team Compass should make our organizational policy, structure, and team practices explicit.
It also delegates authority to other groups, processes, and locations.
See the sections below for more information.[^1]

[^1]: A Team Compass is common in the Jupyter ecoystem (e.g., [here is JupyterHub's Team Compass](https://jupyterhub-team-compass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index-team_guides.html)). In fact, Jupyter's governance model will soon [require that sub-projects have their own Team Compass](https://jupyter.org/governance/software_subprojects.html?responsibilities-of-jupyter-subprojects)

The Team Compass is always evolving as our community learns and changes.
To propose a change to the Team Compass, see [](governance:policy-decision).
