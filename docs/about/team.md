# Team members

This project has had contributions from many different people and organizations.
Below we list each, including their present or past roles.

## Steering Council

The Steering Council is currently comprised of the three Principal Investigators of the original grant funding the project: [Chris Holdgraf](https://github.com/choldgraf), [John Stachurski](https://github.com/jstac), and [Greg Caporaso](https://github.com/gregcaporaso).

They are listed [in this GitHub Team](https://github.com/orgs/executablebooks/teams/steering-council).

```{note}
We expect the Steering Council to expand in the future, and this initial Steering Council will define policies that set the expectations for steering council membership as well as the process for modifying or expanding the steering council membership in the future.
```
