# Communication Channels

There are a few channels for communication depending on what you're trying to do.
Here are some of the major pieces:

## Discussion Forum

We have [a GitHub Discussions Forum](https://github.com/orgs/executablebooks/discussions) for all of our GitHub repositories (rather than using one forum per repository).
Our forum has general conversation about how to use our tools, free-form questions, ideas, discussions, etc.
Generally it is *not* a place for "project planning" and coordination (those are in [GitHub Issues](comms:issues))
This is open to anybody, and is a space where people can ask questions and help one another.
Please feel free to provide support, advice, etc to anybody on this forum.

## GitHub Issues

For conversations around specific actions, tasks, features, etc, we use GitHub issues in each repository.
Use these issues as a general place to understand what work is on our radar, and feel free to comment and add üëç reactions to voice your support for certain changes.

## Team Slack

Our team communicates via a Slack channel at [ebp.slack.com/](https://ebp.slack.com/).
If you'd like access, please reach out to a core team member to discuss!

## Email

% ref: https://github.com/executablebooks/meta/discussions/412 to share password/access
We have an e-mail address at `executablebooks@gmail.com`.
All core team members should have access to this email, though it is not currently actively monitored by the team.

## Team Meetings

We also conduct (roughly) monthly team meetings via video chat.
Anybody is welcome to join these meetings!
For more information, see [](meetings/index.md).
