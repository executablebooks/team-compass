# External communication

These sections cover our practices and resources for communicating _outside_ of the project.

## Blog

We have a blog at [`executablebooks.org/en/latest/blog`](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/blog/).
This is most-often used for major project updates, but can also be used to discuss particular decisions or features in more detail, give general updates about what we are up to, etc.
Generally speaking, we post under a generic "Executable Books" author byline, keep doing this until we define authorship guidelines for posts.

## Social media accounts

We have two Twitter accounts as a centralized place where people can follow to learn about updates in our project.

- [`@executablebooks`](https://twitter.com/executablebooks): Covers general project updates and the broader Jupyter Book, Sphinx, etc ecosystem.
- [`@myst_tools`](https://twitter.com/myst_tools): Specific to MyST Markdown, open MEP proposals and their decisions, syntax updates, etc.

We use these accounts to "push" information and boost the visibility of the project.
We do not use them to engage in discourse with others on social media.

Use these accounts to announce new releases and major features, upcoming events, and generally helpful information to our community.

## Giving presentations

In some cases team members may be asked to give presentations on behalf of the Executable Books project.
We do not yet have a formal policy for giving presentations.
In the meantime, the [JupyterHub external communications practices](https://jupyterhub-team-compass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/practices/external-communication.html) are a good place to start.

### Presentation resources

[Our `Talks/` folder in the Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZWPEevJ5feJxzGlW_Q4ykugXUujChI93?usp=share_link) has several slides from old talks that have been given by team members.
If you give a talk, consider adding it so that others may learn or re-use the content.
