# Shared accounts and services

There are a few resources that the team shares to reduce redundancy, save time, and standardize our practices.
This page has a few major pieces.

## Design assets

The Executable Books team uses [this Figma board](https://www.figma.com/file/ZptZUfzGznnT8GhIplnZBU/icon) to store its logo and other visual design assets.
Anybody can access these assets, though only core team members can edit them.

## Google drive

We have [a shared Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lg4YpS3BpMnra4bVmkwfaTmYGYn42l3d?usp=sharing) where we store some assets like presentations and documents.
Access to this Google Drive is restricted to core team members.

Some useful things in the drive:

- [Presentation slides for re-use by team members](#external-communication:presentations)
- [The original grant that funded this project](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VV05Jg3PvT_-jr4PoMsgS7kGuv40ERcs?usp=share_link)

If there's shared information that would benefit from being in this Drive, please add it and link it here.

## `ebp-bot`

We have a GitHub user that is dedicated to automation and scripting for the organization.
Its name is [`@ebp-bot`](https://github.com/ebp-bot).
It has maintain permissions over Executable Books repositories, and we use its **Personal Access Token** to allow API access to our Actions and ReadTheDocs jobs.
This allows us to have programmatic access to EB resources without requiring a single team member to provide an access token.

Ask a {team}`Core Team` member for access to the `@ebp-bot` account.
